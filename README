This is the frondend code for the distributedcracking.net software.

Configuration is done in the file called 'config.php'
The directory 'temp' needs to be writeable by the user running Apache (or PHP).
The API the client is communicating with is located under 'api/'.


A LAMP-installation is required and you'll probably want to configure Apache 
in a fashion similar to the one below.

<VirtualHost *>
        ServerAdmin     admin@EXAMPLE.NET
        ServerName      EXAMPLE.NET

        ErrorLog        /opt/logs/distributedcracking.net-insecure-errorlog
        CustomLog       /opt/logs/distributedcracking.net-insecure-combined combined
        LogLevel        notice

        RewriteEngine on
        RewriteRule ^/(.*)$     https://distributedcracking.net/$1      [L,R=302]
